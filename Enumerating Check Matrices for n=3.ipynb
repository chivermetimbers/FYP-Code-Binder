    "The formula we are going to be working with is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_{\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle} = \\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle \\left\\langle\\psi\\right| = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\prod^{n}_{i=1} \\left(\\mathbf{I} + g_i\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $\\rho_{\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle}$ is the density matrix of the quantum state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle$\n",
    "* $n$ is the number of qubits we are working with\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, which is of size $2^n\\times 2^n$\n",
    "* $g_i$ are the generators of size $2^n\\times 2^n$, of the stabilizer group $S\\subseteq P_{n}$\n",
    "* $P_n$ is the Pauli group on n qubits\n",

    "### Functions Manipulating Gates in Pauli and Symplectic Form\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to convert gates from their Pauli representation to their symplectic form is very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base gates and their associated matrices are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix} \\;\\; Z = \\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix} \\;\\; Y = \\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\\\i&0\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pauli representation is the gates' most typical form. An example of such representation is $X \\otimes I \\otimes Z \\otimes Y$. This shows that an $X$ gate acts on the first qubit, the second qubit is unchanged, a $Z$ gate acts on the third qubit, and $Y$ acts on the fourth qubit. Usually when represented in this way the tensor product notation is collapsed on, such that the gates would be instead written as $XIZY$. Noting that $(X)(Z) = iY$, these gates may also be represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{P} = (-1)^c(-i)^{\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{p}}(X)^\\vec{q}(Z)^\\vec{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symplectic representation of quantum gates is another way of describing whether an X and/or Z gate is acting on a qubit. It uses the equation above and hilights just the vectors $\\vec{q},\\vec{p}$ and $c$. For instance the example gate above may be rewritten in its symplectic form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$XIZY \\rightarrow \\left(--\\vec{q}--|--\\vec{p}--|c\\right) = \\left(1,0,0,1|0,0,1,1|0\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this representation is multiplication of gates becomes addition of their symplectic binary strings:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(X ⊗ I ⊗ Z ⊗ Y )(−X ⊗ Y ⊗ X ⊗ X) &= [1, 0, 0, 1|0, 0, 1, 1|0]\\\\\n",
    "&+ [1, 1, 1, 1|0, 1, 0, 0|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= [0, 1, 1, 0|0, 1, 1, 1|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= −I ⊗ Y ⊗ Y ⊗ Z\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the addition is only perfect if the twisted inner product of the two gates is equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_1 \\odot g_2 = \\vec{q}_1\\cdot\\vec{p}_2 \\oplus \\vec{q}_2\\cdot\\vec{p}_1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures there are no unwanted imaginary phases, and hence why we may regard the phase bit as only being binary and not quaternary.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that information in mind, we needed to create some functions that could do the following:\n",
    "* Convert a gate from its Pauli representation to its symplectic form\n",
    "* Multiply two sumplectic gates together\n",
    "* Keep the phases of the multiplied gates in check\n",
    "* Convert a gate from its symplectic form to its Pauli representation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "We have in previous notebooks managed to show the possible symplectic combinations for $n=2$ is $60$, using the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The combination must contain gates that are linearly independant (in their symplectic forms). This means $g_i \\neq \\mathbf{I}$, and $g_i \\neq \\pm g_j$\n",
    "* The twisted inner product of the gates' symplectic forms must equal zero mod 2; $g_i \\odot g_j = 0 \\;\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\;,\\;\\forall i,j\\in \\{1,2,...,n\\}\\;,\\;i\\neq j$ \n",
    "* The set of multiples of gates possible through the equation $\\prod^{n}_{i=1} \\left(\\mathbf{I} + g_i\\right)$ are unique, and also are all linearly independant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to count the possible unique gates that will form a symplectic basis for $n=3$. We expect to find $1080$ once all the rules above have been followed"
