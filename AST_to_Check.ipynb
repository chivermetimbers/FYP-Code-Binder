    "## Functions Manipulating Gates in Pauli and Symplectic Form\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to convert gates from their Pauli representation to their symplectic form is very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base gates and their associated matrices are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix} \\;\\; Z = \\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{pmatrix} \\;\\; Y = \\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\\\i&0\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pauli representation is the gates' most typical form. An example of such representation is $X \\otimes I \\otimes Z \\otimes Y$. This shows that an $X$ gate acts on the first qubit, the second qubit is unchanged, a $Z$ gate acts on the third qubit, and $Y$ acts on the fourth qubit. Usually when represented in this way the tensor product notation is collapsed on, such that the gates would be instead written as $XIZY$. Noting that $(X)(Z) = iY$, these gates may also be represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{P} = (-1)^c(-i)^{\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{p}}(X)^\\vec{q}(Z)^\\vec{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symplectic representation of quantum gates is another way of describing whether an X and/or Z gate is acting on a qubit. It uses the equation above and hilights just the vectors $\\vec{q},\\vec{p}$ and $c$. For instance the example gate above may be rewritten in its symplectic form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$XIZY \\rightarrow \\left(--\\vec{q}--|--\\vec{p}--|c\\right) = \\left(1,0,0,1|0,0,1,1|0\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this representation is multiplication of gates becomes addition of their symplectic binary strings:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(X ⊗ I ⊗ Z ⊗ Y )(−X ⊗ Y ⊗ X ⊗ X) &= [1, 0, 0, 1|0, 0, 1, 1|0]\\\\\n",
    "&+ [1, 1, 1, 1|0, 1, 0, 0|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= [0, 1, 1, 0|0, 1, 1, 1|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= −I ⊗ Y ⊗ Y ⊗ Z\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the addition is only perfect if the twisted inner product of the two gates is equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_1 \\odot g_2 = \\vec{q}_1\\cdot\\vec{p}_2 \\oplus \\vec{q}_2\\cdot\\vec{p}_1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures there are no unwanted imaginary phases, and hence why we may regard the phase bit as only being binary and not quaternary.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that information in mind, we needed to create some functions that could do the following:\n",
    "* Convert a gate from its Pauli representation to its symplectic form\n",
    "* Multiply two sumplectic gates together\n",
    "* Keep the phases of the multiplied gates in check\n",
    "* Convert a gate from its symplectic form to its Pauli representation"
