    "## Finding the combos\n",
    "In order to find the 60 posible symplectic combinations we must outline the rules the combinations need to follow. To do this I will show how we come to find that there are 60 suitable combinations of symplectic basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symplectic overview\n",
    "The Pauli representation is the gates' most typical form. An example of such representation is $X \\otimes I \\otimes Z \\otimes Y$. This shows that an $X$ gate acts on the first qubit, the second qubit is unchanged, a $Z$ gate acts on the third qubit, and $Y$ acts on the fourth qubit. Usually when represented in this way the tensor product notation is collapsed on, such that the gates would be instead written as $XIZY$. Noting that $(X)(Z) = iY$, these gates may also be represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{P} = (-1)^c(-i)^{\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{p}}(X)^\\vec{q}(Z)^\\vec{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symplectic representation of quantum gates is another way of describing whether an X and/or Z gate is acting on a qubit. It uses the equation above and hilights just the vectors $\\vec{q},\\vec{p}$ and $c$. For instance the example gate above may be rewritten in its symplectic form as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$XIZY \\rightarrow \\left(--\\vec{q}--|--\\vec{p}--|c\\right) = \\left(1,0,0,1|0,0,1,1|0\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this representation is multiplication of gates becomes addition of their symplectic binary strings:\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(X ⊗ I ⊗ Z ⊗ Y )(−X ⊗ Y ⊗ X ⊗ X) &= [1, 0, 0, 1|0, 0, 1, 1|0]\\\\\n",
    "&+ [1, 1, 1, 1|0, 1, 0, 0|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= [0, 1, 1, 0|0, 1, 1, 1|1]\\\\\n",
    "&= −I ⊗ Y ⊗ Y ⊗ Z\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the addition is only perfect if the twisted inner product of the two gates is equal to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_1 \\odot g_2 = \\vec{q}_1\\cdot\\vec{p}_2 \\oplus \\vec{q}_2\\cdot\\vec{p}_1 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures there are no unwanted imaginary phases, and hence why we may regard the phase bit as only being binary and not quaternary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The two qubit case, before deductions\n",
    "For the two qubit case we have gates in the form $g = \\left(x_1,x_2|z_1,z_2|r\\right)$. For now I will ignore the phase, so we are left with $g = \\left(x_1,x_2|z_1,z_2\\right)$. This gives $2^{2n} = 2^4 = 16$ possible combinations for the gates. Since a symplectic basis for two qubits is represented using two gates;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix} ---g_1--- \\\\ ---g_2---\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we are left with $(2^4)(2^4) = 256$ posibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $g_1$ can't be Identity\n",
    "Our first deduction will be the identity gate from $g_1$. This is because it is trivial, every state is stabilized by the identity, so we find nothing interesting by keeping it around. I shall keep the identity in $g_2$ for another little bit, but not long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible bases: $(2^4-1)(2^4) = 240$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Twisted inner product of the Symplectic form\n",
    "The next limitation we need is that the twisted inner product of the gates' symplectic forms must equal zero mod 2;\n",
    "$$g_1 \\odot g_2 = 0 \\;\\mathbb{Z}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Every $g_2$ must follow this rule for every $g_1$. Since we are working with mod 2, and because $g_2$ iterates over every possile combination of four zeros and ones, it is safe to assume we will get rid of half of the $g_2$s for every $g_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible bases: $(2^4-1)(2^3) = 120$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearity\n",
    "The gates in the symplectic basis must be linearly independant of one another. This means for every $g_1$, we get rid of the identity (as $0\\cdot g_1 = \\mathbf{I}_4$) and its copy ($1\\cdot g_1 = g_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible bases: $(2^4-1)(2^3-2) = 90$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Double counting\n",
    "Given two gates $g_1$ and $g_2$, we can calculate a gate $g_3$ also in that basis via the product of the first two. This new gate can be swapped in for $g_2$, and we still have the same basis;\n",
    "$\\begin{pmatrix} ---g_1--- \\\\ ---g_2---\\end{pmatrix}$ where $g_1 \\cdot g_2 = g_3$ has the same basis as $\\begin{pmatrix} ---g_1--- \\\\ ---g_3---\\end{pmatrix}$ where $g_1 \\cdot g_3 = g_2$ (still ignoring phases for now).This halves the amount of possible choices for $g_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible bases: $(2^4-1)(2^2-1) = 45$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Triple counting\n",
    "Using the same concept as above, we can show that the following representations form the same basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} ---g_1--- \\\\ ---g_2---\\end{pmatrix} \\; , \\; \\begin{pmatrix} ---g_2--- \\\\ ---g_3---\\end{pmatrix} \\;,\\; \\begin{pmatrix} ---g_3--- \\\\ ---g_1---\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This further divides our list of choices by 3, leaving us with a grand total number of symplectic basis of $\\frac{1}{3}(2^4-1)(2^2-1) = 15$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bringing the Phases back\n",
    "For every gate we have we can use a plus or minus form, ie we can use $[+g_1,+g_2], [+g_1,-g_2], [-g_1,+g_2], [-g_1,-g_2]$\n",
    "This multiplies the number of basis by 4: $\\frac{4}{3}(2^4-1)(2^2-1) = 60$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Now that I have outlined the steps we need to find the symplectic bases, I just need to implement them. I will get rid of the identity from $g_1$, check the twisted inner product, apply linearity and scrap any copies. "
